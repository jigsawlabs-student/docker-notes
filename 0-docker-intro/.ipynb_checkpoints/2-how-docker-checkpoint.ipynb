In our last lesson, this task was booting up the ghost platform on our computer.  Think about all that needed to occur.  We needed to have the correct underlying software installed (Ghost uses node), download the ghost codebase, and initialize a database along with all of necessary tables, among other things.  With Docker we were able to do this, without worrying about any underlying steps."
