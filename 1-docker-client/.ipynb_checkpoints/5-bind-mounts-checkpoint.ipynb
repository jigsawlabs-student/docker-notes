    "This is a powerful concept.  By separating the storage of our notebooks or data from our container, we can work with that data in separate environments.  So, for example, with Jupyter, we can simply use a different Jupyter container or image to begin using our data.  Perhaps we have `csv` data that we want to use in with a Jupyter image sometime, and a database, a la postgres, other times.  We could use bind mounting to connect data on our local machine to a postgres containers sometimes and a jupyter contain when we prefer to use Jupyter."

    "In this lesson, we saw one mechanism for using data inside of a container: using bind mounts.  With bind mounts, we map data from host machine to the container.  As we saw, the connection works both ways.  That is, any mounted data we change from inside of our container will update the corresponding directory on the local machine, and any changes we make inside of the mounted folder will be seen inside of the container.  We mount our data by running a container with the `-v host_folder:container_folder` as in:\n",
